  - question: What is SNX27-Retromer?
    answer: |
      Sorting nexin-27 (SNX27)-Retromer is an endosomal sorting complex that orchestrates
      endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling of hundreds of internalized receptors,
      channels and transporters, enzymes and adhesion molecules
  - question: What is the role of the endosomal-lysosomal network?
    answer: |
      A central role of the endosomal-lysosomal network is to determine the sorting of integral
      proteins and their associated proteins and lipids, collectively termed ‘cargos’, between
      two fates, either degradation within lysosomes or retrieval from this fate for the promotion
      of recycling to a variety of organelles that include the cell surface (Cullen and Steinberg,
      2018).
  - question: What concepts are considered to account for the mechanism of endosomal cargo retrieval and recycling?
    answer: |
      Sequence-independent sorting posits that sorting can proceed
      without the need for any sequence information within the intracellular cytoplasmic
      domains of integral membrane cargos (Maxfield and McGraw, 2004). On the other hand,
      sequence-dependent sorting is controlled by specific signals in the cytoplasmic domain
      of cargos. These signals are typically short linear peptide motifs that direct the sorting
      process through coupling to ancient and evolutionary conserved coat complexes (Cullen
      and Steinberg, 2018; McNally and Cullen, 2018; Chen et al., 2019).
  - question: Which protein complexes are involved in the sequence recognition of cargo?
    answer: |
      In mammals, these coats include sorting nexin-3 (SNX3)-Retromer (Strochlic
      et al., 2007; Harterink et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2016; Kendall et al., 2020; Leneva et al.,
      2021), SNX27-Retromer (Lauffer et al., 2010; Temkin et al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2013;
      Gallon et al., 2014), SNX17-Retriever (McNally et al., 2017), the CCC

      actin polymerizing WASH (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue)
      complex (Gomez and Billadeau, 2009; Derivery et al., 2009).
  - question: What are the functional protein domains of SNX27?
    answer: |
      Sorting nexin-27 (SNX27) is an endosome-associated cargo adaptor composed of a
      central PX (phox homology) domain flanked by an N-terminal PDZ (PSD95, discs large,
      zona occludens) domain and a C-terminal FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain (Kajii
      et al., 2003; Ghai et al., 2011). The PDZ domain recognizes a specific sorting motif,
      termed the PDZ binding motif (PDZbm), present at the very C-termini of over 400 cargo
      proteins including receptors, transporters, channels, enzymes and adhesion molecules
      (Joubert et al., 2004; Lunn et al., 2007; Lauffer et al., 2010; Balana et al., 2011; Cai et al.,
      2011; Ghai et al., 2011; Temkin et al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2013; Hussain et al., 2014;
      Clairfeuille et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2020; McMillan et al., 2021)
  - question: What is SNX27's role with Retromer?
    answer: |
      To facilitate the retrieval process, the SNX27 PDZ domain associates with Retromer, a
      stable heterotrimer of VPS26 (A and B isoforms expressed in humans (Kerr et al., 2005)),
      VPS35 and VPS29, to form the SNX27-Retromer (Temkin et al., 2011; Steinberg et al.,
      2013; Gallon et al., 2014). Retromer itself assembles to form dimeric arches that may
      cluster SNX27 captured cargos (Kovtun et al., 2018; Kendall et al., 2020; Leneva et al.,
      2021) and associates with the WASH complex to allow the localized Arp2/3-dependent
      polymerisation of branched filamentous actin (Harbour et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2012).
